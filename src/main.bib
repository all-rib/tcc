   abstract = {Electronic beehive monitoring extracts critical information on colony behavior and phenology without invasive beehive inspections and transportation costs. As an integral component of electronic beehive monitoring, audio beehive monitoring has the potential to automate the identification of various stressors for honeybee colonies from beehive audio samples. In this investigation, we designed several convolutional neural networks and compared their performance with four standard machine learning methods (logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and random forests) in classifying audio samples from microphones deployed above landing pads of Langstroth beehives. On a dataset of 10,260 audio samples where the training and testing samples were separated from the validation samples by beehive and location, a shallower raw audio convolutional neural network with a custom layer outperformed three deeper raw audio convolutional neural networks without custom layers and performed on par with the four machine learning methods trained to classify feature vectors extracted from raw audio samples. On a more challenging dataset of 12,914 audio samples where the training and testing samples were separated from the validation samples by beehive, location, time, and bee race, all raw audio convolutional neural networks performed better than the four machine learning methods and a convolutional neural network trained to classify spectrogram images of audio samples. A trained raw audio convolutional neural network was successfully tested in situ on a low voltage Raspberry Pi computer, which indicates that convolutional neural networks can be added to a repertoire of in situ audio classification algorithms for electronic beehive monitoring. The main trade-off between deep learning and standard machine learning is between feature engineering and training time: while the convolutional neural networks required no feature engineering and generalized better on the second, more challenging dataset, they took considerably more time to train than the machine learning methods. To ensure the replicability of our findings and to provide performance benchmarks for interested research and citizen science communities, we have made public our source code and our curated datasets.},

   abstract = {Beekeeping is one of the widespread and traditional fields in agriculture, where Internet of Things (IoT)-based solutions and machine learning approaches can ease and improve beehive management significantly. A particularly important activity is bee swarming. A beehive monitoring system can be applied for digital farming to alert the user via a service about the beginning of swarming, which requires a response. An IoT-based bee activity acoustic classification system is proposed in this paper. The audio data needed for acoustic training was collected from the Open Source Beehives Project. The input audio signal was converted into feature vectors, using the Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (with cepstral mean normalization) and Linear Predictive Coding. The influence of the acoustic background noise and denoising procedure was evaluated in an additional step. Different Hidden Markov Models’ and Gaussian Mixture Models’ topologies were developed for acoustic modeling, with the objective being to determine the most suitable one for the proposed IoT-based solution. The evaluation was carried out with a separate test set, in order to successfully classify sound between the normal and swarming conditions in a beehive. The evaluation results showed that good acoustic classification performance can be achieved with the proposed system.},

We discovered that, while confronting attacks by the Oriental hornet Vespa orientalis, Apis mellifera cypria honeybees engage in a distinct acoustic behaviour: they produce a characteristic hissing sound of unexpectedly high frequency. When recording and analysing these hissing sounds during an extended sample of artificial attacks by hornets, we found that honeybees can produce sounds covering a wide frequency spectrum with a dominant frequency around 6 kHz. Notably, these acoustic emissions are distinct from the background noise of neighbouring flying bees. These results provide a detailed description of the sounds generated by A. m. cypria when defending their nest against hornets, and they could be used for future research to better understand the biological function of the acoustic behaviour in honeybees' colony defence. © 2008 INRA DIB-AGIB EDP Sciences.},

   abstract = {Sound and vibrational signals exchanged by honeybees during the performance of wagging dances were simultaneously recorded by means of a microphone and a laser vibrometer. Previous descriptions of the 280-Hz sounds emitted by the dancing bee were confirmed, and no vibrational (substrate-borne) component could be detected. In contrast, the 320-Hz "begging signals" (emitted by bees following a dancer and used as a request for food samples from the dancer) do vibrate the comb with peak-peak displacement amplitudes up to 1.5 μm. Artificially-generated comb vibrations of sufficient amplitude cause bees standing on the comb to "freeze". The threshold for obtaining a detectable freezing response was measured for frequencies between 100 Hz and 3 kHz. At 320 Hz it is just below the amplitude of the natural begging signals. Thus it seems likely that these signals are received by the bees as vibrations of the comb. The propagation velocity of waves, damping, and mechanical input impedance of honeybee combs were studied. These results, combined with the observed amplitudes of the begging signals, support the assumption that the begging signals are generated with the flight muscles. The begging signal propagates as a bending wave. The attenuation of the begging signal with distance is relatively small, so the amplitude of the signal probably needs to be carefully adjusted in order to restrict the range of the communication. © 1986 Springer-Verlag.},

Honey bees have a key role in pollination services of both cultivated and spontaneous flora, and the increase in bee mortality could lead to an ecological and economical damage. Despite many smart monitoring systems for honey bees and bee hives, relying on different sensors and measured quantities, have been proposed over the years, the most promising ones are based on sound analysis. Sounds are used by the bees to communicate within the hive, and their analysis can reveal useful information to understand the colony health status and to detect sudden variations, just by using a simple microphone and an acquisition system.

Thus, the practical application of HMMs in modern systems involves considerable sophistication. The aim of this review is first to present the core architecture of a HMM-based LVCSR system and then describe the various refinements which are needed to achieve state-of-the-art performance. These refinements include feature projection, improved covariance modelling, discriminative parameter estimation, adaptation and normalisation, noise compensation and multi-pass system combination. The review concludes with a case study of LVCSR for Broadcast News and Conversation transcription in order to illustrate the techniques described. © 2008 M. Gales and S. Young.},

abstract = {The performance of the Mel-Frequency Cepstrum Coefficients (MFCC) may be affected by (1) the number of filters, (2) the shape of filters, (3) the way in which filters are spaced, and (4) the way in which the power spectrum is warped. In this paper, several comparison experiments are done to find a best implementation. The traditional MFCC calculation excludes the 0th coefficient for the reason that it is regarded as somewhat unreliable. According to the analysis and experiments, the authors find that it can be regarded as the generalized frequency band energy (FBE) and is hence useful, which results in the FBE-MFCC. The authors also propose a better analysis, namely the auto-regressive analysis, on the frame energy, which outperform its 1st and/or 2nd order differential derivatives. Experiments with the “863” Speech Database show that, compared with the traditional MFCC with its corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients, the FBE-MFCC and the frame energy with their corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients form the best combination, reducing the Chinese syllable error rate (CSER) by about 10\%, while the FBE-MFCC with the corresponding auto-regressive analysis coefficients reduces CSER by 2.5\%. Comparison experiments are also done with a quite casual Chinese speech database, named Chinese Annotated Spontaneous Speech (CASS) corpus. The FBE-MFCC can reduce the error rate by about 2.9\% on an average.},
